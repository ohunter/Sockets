# Sockets

A simple git repo for socket development in C++ without the need for a huge amount of external dependencies such as Boost. OpenSSL support is planned. The underlying implementation is based on C++11, but ideally it would be updated to support more modern features such as those in C++ 17 and 20.

## Examples

### [Example 0](https://github.com/ohunter/Sockets/examples/0)

This example is a TCP echo server which dies after connecting and sending one message.
