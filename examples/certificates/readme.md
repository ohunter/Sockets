# Certificates

In this folder there is a script. It should be used to build the certificates needed for the examples which utilize TLS. They should only be used with the examples in this repo as they provide little to no security due to the way that they are configured. For other applications you have to figure out how you want to set up your certificates as the way it is done here is just to check that the executables work as expected. A great resource for this topic is the OpenSSL Cookbook by Ivan RistiÄ‡.
